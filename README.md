I am tired of starting things from scratch for `python 3`.

##### ***important***
Is this a framework ? **NO**

## Before your run

You need to installthe required packages for this to work. But at this point you already have everything i.e. `selenium`. Still here's how to install the requirements

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## How to use ?

Just update the configurations inside `core / app.py`. You're good to go.

To run just do a `python3 scraper.py`
